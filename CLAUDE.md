# imps — Island of Misfit Patches Storage

Patch carrier for third-party projects, replacing maintained forks. The
maintainer has git work he wants applied to other people's projects without
managing GitHub forks of them: imps stores the patch series plus the scripts
that fetch pristine upstream source at a pinned commit, apply the patches,
and build/run the result — eventually both on the host and in a podman
container. One folder per project; each folder is self-contained.

## Per-project folder contract

- `fetch.sh` — clone upstream (URL and pinned full base SHA live in this
  script, the SHA commented with its date and the upstream branch it was
  taken from), checkout the pin, `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
  Idempotent; never destroys local branches or committed work.
- `build.sh` — host build; calls `fetch.sh` when the checkout is missing, so
  it is the only command a fresh clone needs.
- `run.sh` — launch the installed binary with `runDir/` as the game's cwd
  (saves, config, logs, extracted assets accumulate there).
- `patches/` (planned, next phase) — `git format-patch` series applied with
  `git am` on top of the pin.
- `.gitignore` — the upstream checkout, `build-cmake/`, `bldInstall/`, and
  `runDir/` are all untracked.

## Rules

- Scripts start with `cd "$(dirname "$0")"` and use only relative paths —
  runnable from anywhere, no hardcoded home/host paths.
- Moving a pin is a deliberate act: after any pin bump, re-verify the patch
  series applies and the project builds before committing the new SHA.
- ROM/asset acquisition is out of scope — each game's own in-app extraction
  handles it in `runDir/`. Never commit the upstream checkout or anything
  ROM-derived.

## Projects

- `OcarinaOfTime/` — Ship of Harkinian
  (https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright), pinned at `acdbc651d`
  (tip of `develop`, 2026-09-01; submodules libultraship + torch). Status:
  pristine — the maintainer's patches are not yet ported.
